# sql_ig_database

This is a project where I use mySQL to create a database schema for an Instagram clone.

The website I work with is very similar to Instagram, where people can post pictures, 
comment, like posts, follow people, include hashtags in posts, and a couple of other things.

This means the database schema still includes many of the important tables and relationships, which we would see in the real Instagram database schema. 

The repository includes the code where I create the tables, the code I use to insert the data, and 
finally, the code I use to analyze the data given different tasks.
