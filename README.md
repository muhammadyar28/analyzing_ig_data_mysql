# sql_ig_data_analysis

In this project I use MySQL to create a database schema for an Instagram clone.

The application I work with is very similar to Instagram, where people can post pictures, comment, like posts, follow people, and include hashtags in posts.

This means the database schema still includes many of the important tables and relationships which we would see in the real Instagram database schema.
The code I use to biuld the data scehema can be found in the ig_database.sql file. 

I then play the role of a data analyst and analyze the data given different cases and provide the solutions for each case. 
More details about the cases and my solutions for the them can be found in the ig_data_analysis.sql file.  

This repository includes the code where I create the tables, the code I use to insert the data, and finally, the code I use to analyze the data given different cases. I also provide a pdf slide which summarizes the different cases along with my approach, and how I came to the solution.
